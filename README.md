# nhgis_api_workflow

As part of the I-GUIDE Data Catalog project, this repository contains ready-to-use python code snippets/notebooks to access and utilize data from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS), which is housed within IPUMS at the University of Minnesota.

NHGIS provides both cross-sectional and longitudinal aggregate data from historical and current censuses, as well as geographic boundary (GIS) files that can be used with these tabular data products. This notebook demonstrates uses and functionality of the API interface provided by IPUMS for NHGIS to access and request data in a reproducible and documentable Python workflow.
